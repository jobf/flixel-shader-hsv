# adjust hue, saturation, brightness of flixel sprite

This is almost a direct implementation of the code discussed here - https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/59797/glsl-shader-change-hue-saturation-brightness

Made a couple of small tweaks 
 
 - mod h s and b
 - include normalized line in hsv2rgb function
