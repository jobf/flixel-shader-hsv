# adjust hue, saturation, brightness of flixel sprite

DEMO -> https://jobf.github.io/flixel-shader-hsv/

This is almost a direct implementation of the code discussed here - https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/59797/glsl-shader-change-hue-saturation-brightness

Made a couple of small tweaks 
 
 - mod hue
 - include normalized line in hsv2rgb function
